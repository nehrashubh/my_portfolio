## 🤖 AI Transparency

**Note on Development:**
This project was built with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence.
* **Concept & Architecture:** Designed by Shubhankar Nehra.
* **Code Generation:** AI was used to accelerate the writing of boilerplate code, complex CSS animations (scanlines/glows), and TypeScript interfaces.
* **Debugging:** AI served as a pair programmer for troubleshooting and logic.

I believe in transparency regarding the tools used in my workflow. While AI helped build the ship, I am the captain who steered it.
